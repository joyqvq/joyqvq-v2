      "content_text": "A closer look on key derivations with relation to curve operations. This post is a more general discussion on key derivation applying to broader cryptocurrency usage. You can find my writing on the Sui Network specifically here.\nBIP-32 and SLIP-0010 are both excellent standards on how key management works, and they both have extensive implementations across many languages. However, I struggle to find a good reading on why some constructions are needed and how they relate to the RFCs on different curves.",

First, we make a promise: a committer publishes a value and it binds to the message without revealing it.\nHow do we know a promise is kept? Second, he can choose to reveal the message to a verifier, who can check if the message is indeed what he previously published.",
